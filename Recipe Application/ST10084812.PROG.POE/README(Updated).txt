Introduction to program:
This program is a recipe manager, it allows users to create and change or modify recipes.
I created this program using C# and it uses the .NETframework.

How to run the program:
For this program to run you will need to:
Open a command prompt or window.
Navigate to where the program is located.
The program can be compiled, then ran.

An alternate method would be:
Using an IDE, such as Visual Studio.this would be more simple, you can open the project directly from the IDE.
These methods are aplicable for Windows and Linux products

Program features:
This program will allow you to create a recipe by entering a name. the amount and the measurement(unit)for each ingredient. It will also allow you to create a list of steps for the preperation of the recipe.
There is also scaling, you can scale a recipe up or down factor of (0.5,2,3).
Users can also reset the quantity of the ingredient to the orginal value by command.
Users can clear the recipe, if you want to start over and begin again.
(Part 2) Additonal Features.
Users can enter a name for their recipe.
Users can add an unlimited amount of recipes.
Users can input calories.
Users can select a recipe they want to display.
Users recipes are displayed in alphabetical order.
Users get a warning if the calories exceed 300.
(POE)
Converted to WPF.
Easier to use UI.
Implemented previous features.


Note: When the program closes, all previous data is cleared.
This program does not overwhelm the user with multiple features, it is simple & flexible, with to the point features.

Note: Used class activities to better understand methods which were excuted in the program.

Brief description of changes: (Based on feedback from Part 1)
Scaling with user units: I modified the code to prompt the user for their preferred units during the scaling operation. Now, users can choose the units they prefer, providing them with more flexibility and customization options.

String manipulation: I reviewed and revised the relevant code sections, ensuring that I am using appropriate methods and techniques for string manipulation. Through testing, I verified that my code handles different scenarios accurately, allowing for proper manipulation of strings.

Exception handling: I identified areas in my code where exceptions could occur, such as user input or file operations. By implementing try-catch blocks, I added appropriate exception handling techniques to catch and gracefully handle these exceptions. Users will now receive meaningful error messages instead of experiencing program crashes.

Readme file styling: I enhanced the visual appeal and organization of my readme file by adding correct headings and a better layout.

Code attribution: I ensured that my readme file includes proper code attribution, giving credit to any external sources or libraries used in my project. By adding a dedicated section and providing links or references to the original code or documentation, I acknowledged the work of others and maintained ethical coding practices.

To conclude, I have reviewed my part 1 and 2, added additional functionalities for the requirements sourced from feedback. Overall, my modifications have successfully addressed the mentioned issues, improving the functionality, readability, and user experience of my project.
