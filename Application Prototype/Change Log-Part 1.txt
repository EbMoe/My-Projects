Innovative features:

For part one I have changed my innovative features to assist me in the addition of adding two new features of my own, the previous mentioned features in my part 1 submission were too complex.

Changed the above mentioned to:

• UI: Alpha will incorporate a modern age user-friendly interface which will allow users to 
seamlessly navigate throughout the application. Ultimately this will enhance user 
experience and productivity. 
• Tutorial: I will add a feature that allows users to walk through the application with visual 
aid and guidelines. 
• Share feature: Alpha time tracking will allow users to share the information inputted on 
their timesheet to apps such as the calendar application and various other platforms.

Overall this will assist users and create a better user experience.
